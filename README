Plug-in for creating tags with ctags
in the current working directory of the currently opened
buffer (file), automatically, when you save your file.

This plug-in works with C/C++ files only.

Works in the current working directory. It can include
sub-directories as well. You can generate tags files automatically for easy access through Omni Completions,
and facilitate the plug-in that depends on a tags file.

You can even create tags file in any directory without
saving a file.

For example: code_complete.vim (by Mingbai),
             echofunc.vim (by Mingbai), plug-ins rely on a
             tags file in the working directory
             and the include directories added to vim's search list.

All of this is specified within a simple text file based plug-in script
(auto_tags_gen.vim) with a few global variables and
a shared library (auto_tag_gen.dll). On linux the plug-in is auto_tags_gen_linux.vim and the shared library is libauto_tag_gen.so.

Written For Vim version 7.4. May work with older
versions as well as the future releases also.

    Tested with Vim 32-bit on Windows XP/7 32-bit, Windows 7 64-bit (vim 32-bit),
    may work with Vim 64-bit on Windows 64-bit.
    Now it works on Linux. Tested in ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy) (Gvim from its repository).


You must set 'nocompatible' in your _vimrc file to use this plug-in. You can
stop the plug-in from being loaded by setting the
"loaded_auto_tag_generator" variable:

	:let loaded_auto_tag_generator = 0

in your _vimrc file.
You can also put these lines for your convenience:

set nocompatible
filetype on
filetype plugin on
set number
set laststatus=2
:set timeout timeoutlen=4500 "   ttimeoutlen=100 "  default settings -1 not harmed under comment
set history=100 " tons of command-line history. Can be used with up-dn arrow key
